Serverless ϟ Framework

Welcome to Serverless Framework V.4

This is a Serverless Framework Service. Let's do some quick checks to ensure it's set up correctly.

While the CLI is free for developers and organizations making less than $2 million annually, Serverless Framework's Dashboard offers additional features such as Observability, State, Secrets & AWS Access sharing, which can incur a cost. To enable these additional features, add your Service to an "App". Apps also group your Services together in the Dashboard, for better organization.

Create or select an existing App below to associate with your Service, or skip.

√ Create Or Select An Existing App: · Create A New App

√ Name Your New App: · blockchain-auth

Your Serverless Framework Service is ready to deploy.
